## Captcha bypass

I recommend using simple autoclicker like this

1. Reload tab "CTRL+SHIFT", wait 10 seconds (Optional, but recommended)
2. Click "Draw", wait 15 seconds
3. Click Captcha, wait 5s
4. Click "Paint", wait 30 minutes
5. Repeat

Also I'm using [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) to open multiple bots, each in it's own tab.

## Known issues

1. Once your session on website ends, bot obviously stops.
2. Very big images make everything lag.

## Contribution

2. Install dependencies `bun i`
